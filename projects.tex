\runsubsection{Iris Recognition in Visible Spectrum}
\descript{| May 2016 – Jul 2016}
\location{With Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item As a part of the project we are investigating state of the art iris recognition system using Near Infrared Camera
	\item We are trying to answer: Iris recognition in NIR is well established. Can we approach that baseline in visible spectrum?
	\item We are also exploring possible application of iris recognition in biometric based access control systems.

\runsubsection{FaceTensor : Face Expression Analysis }
\descript{| May 2016 – Jul 2016}
\location{With Dr. Sandip Karmakar}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item As a part of project we investigated state of the art facial expression recognition system
	\item We proposed a system that exploits geometric feature of face to detect facial expression
	\item Build a system that beats present state of the art system
