\runsubsection{Iris Recognition in Visible Spectrum}
\descript{| In Progress}
\location{With Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item As a part of the project we are investigating state of the art iris recognition system using Near Infrared Camera
	\item We are trying to answer: Iris recognition in NIR is well established. Can we approach that baseline in visible spectrum?
	\item We are also exploring possible application of iris recognition in biometric based access control systems.

\runsubsection{FaceTensor : Face Expression Analysis }
\descript{| Spring 2016}
\location{With Dr. Sandip Karmakar}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item As a part of project we investigated state of the art facial expression recognition system
	\item We proposed a system that exploits geometric feature of face to detect facial expression
	\item Build a system that beats present state of the art system
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{TweeSpamAssassin: Spam Detection Engine in OSNs  }
\descript{| Spring 2015}
\location{With Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item We investigated present models to detect spam on twitter.
	\item Inspired by email spam filter we developed a probabilistic based model to detect spam on twitter.
	\item The spam engine was deployed as bowsers plugin to filter out spam on twitter.

\runsubsection{SLANG:  Native language writer}
\descript{| Spring 2014}
\skiplocation
\begin{tightemize}
	\item SLANG enables user write in their native language in English. Similar to what Google keyword (like “hinglish”) is doing.
	\item This was very simple implementation with no use of machine learning.
\end{tightemize}
